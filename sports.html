        <h2>The Houston Rockets Organization</h2>
            <p>
                    The Houtson Rockets were founded in 1967 in San Diego, California before moving to Houston, Texas four years later. 
                In their first season as a franchise, they won 15 games and just two years after that, they made their first playoff
                appearance. The Rockets first trip to the finals came in 1981 where they were eventually deveated by the Celtics in
                6 games. They had to wait another five years to get back to the finals where they lost again to the Celtics. The team
                finally got their big break in 1994 when they won their first championship led by star center Hakeem "The Dream"
                Olajuwon. During the year of their first championship, they also set a franchise record with 58 wins that season.

                    With the new system that head coach Mike D'Antoni has put into play, three-point shooting has become an essential role
                for all players on the team. The top three-point shooters on the team may not be known to most people, but they definitely
                play a role in every game they play. These include: Ben McLemore, P.J. Tucker, Jeff Green, and Danuel House Jr. Each of these 
                guys shoot over 40% from behind the arch and help star players like Harden and Westbrook to keep the team winning. The new offensive 
                strategy does not require a center. Therefore, rebounds from long shots are huge in deciding the outcome of a game. Another 
                important aspect to the game is team play and ball movement. On average, the team completes 2 more passes a possesion than 
                last year. The better ball movement helps get defenders out of postion for lighter contested shots.<br>
